# Day 1 JavaScript Practice

## Problem Statement

Build a program that takes an array of integers and performs the following
operations:

- Calculate the sum of all numbers
- Find the maximum number
- Find the minimum number
- Calculate the average of the numbers

## Input

The program supports two input methods:

1. Pre-defined array inside the code Example: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

2. User-defined input from the terminal Example: 10 20 30 40 50

## Output

Sum: 150  
Maximum: 50  
Minimum: 10  
Average: 30

## Constraints

- Do not use built-in functions like Math.max or Math.min
- Use loops and basic logic
- Write clean and readable code

## Files

- index.js  
  Uses a pre-defined array written directly in the code. Suitable for quick
  testing and understanding the logic.

- userInput.js  
  Accepts space-separated integers from the terminal using Node.js input.
  Suitable for practicing real-world input handling.

## How to Run

### Run with Pre-defined Input

node index.js

### Run with User Input

node userInput.js

Then enter values like: 10 20 30 40 50

## Goal

Practice JavaScript fundamentals including loops, conditionals, and basic
arithmetic operations.
