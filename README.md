# 30 Days MERN Practice Challenge

This repository contains my 30-day hands-on practice journey to build strong
foundations in JavaScript and progress step by step towards full-stack MERN
development. Each day focuses on a problem-driven task where the goal is to
learn by coding rather than following tutorials.

## Objective

- Strengthen JavaScript fundamentals
- Build confidence in React development
- Understand backend development using Node and Express
- Work with MongoDB for data storage
- Combine frontend and backend into full-stack applications
- Practice writing clean, readable, and maintainable code

## Structure

The repository is organized day-wise. Each day contains its own folder with
problem statements, code, and a short README where applicable.

Example structure:

Day01  
Day02  
Day03  
...  
Day30

Each day may include:

- A README describing the problem statement
- One or more JavaScript or project files
- Optional user input or test files

## Rules

- All problems are solved by coding, not copying solutions
- Built-in shortcuts are avoided where mentioned
- Focus is on logic, clarity, and consistency
- Each day’s work is committed separately
- Code is written and pushed daily

## Technologies Covered

- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML and CSS (where required)
- React
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Git and GitHub

## Progress Plan

Days 1–5: JavaScript fundamentals and problem solving  
Days 6–15: React basics to intermediate concepts  
Days 16–20: Backend development with Node and Express  
Days 21–25: MongoDB and full CRUD integration  
Days 26–30: Full-stack MERN project and deployment

## Outcome

By the end of this challenge, the goal is to have:

- Strong problem-solving fundamentals
- Multiple mini-projects
- At least one complete MERN full-stack application
- A consistent GitHub contribution history

## Commitment

This challenge is focused on consistency, discipline, and learning by doing.
Each day represents intentional effort toward becoming a better developer.
